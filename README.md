# Generate new faces

## Introduction
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning, implemented by a system of two neural networks contesting with each other in a zero-sum game framework.

## Project goal
In this project, GANS are used to generate new images of human faces, the notebook in this repositery has all the steps of building, training and examining the network on a step by step basis.
