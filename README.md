# Generate new faces

## Introduction
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning, implemented by a system of two neural networks contesting with each other in a zero-sum game framework.

## Project goal
In this project, GANS are used to generate new images of human faces.
